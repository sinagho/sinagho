## Summary 
----------
I am a detail-oriented health systems engineer with two years of experience in deep learning projects and researches focused on medical imaging. I have a proven track record in research growth and aims to further my studies. Publication are recorded in BMVC, WACV, MedIA, etc. My current research interests include **computer vision**, **multi-modal understanding**, **long-range modeling**, and **deep generative models**.

## EXPERIENCE 
-------------
â€¢ Remote Research Assistant, RWTH Aachen University, Germany (2023-Present)
 - Worked on medical image processing and understanding, particularly on the semantic segmentation task. Currently, I am working on leveraging State Space Models and refining high frequency components in wavelet-based efficient vision transformer in medical image segmentation. results are published and submmited in: (**BMVC**, **WACV**)

â€¢ Remote Research Assistant, University of Regensburg, Germany (2024-Present)
 -I am Working on leveraging Score-based and Physics-inspired Generative models inverse problems (with a particular focus on Diffusion Models) for CT and MRI reconstruction and segmentation.

## Research Collaboration with
----------------------------------------
â€¢ Dorit Merhof, RWTH, Germany (German research chair on Medical Image Analysis) since 2023
â€¢ Ilker Hacihaliloglu, UBC, Canada (Department of Radiology, Department of Medicine.) since 2023
â€¢ Ulas Bagci, Northwestern University, USA (Department of Radiology) since 2024
